# learn-graph-ml
This is a personal project reflecting the course homework for CS224W - Graph Machine Learning which can be found at: 

http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/

The original coursework provides Jupyter notebooks which facilitates the teaching of the material, however all work presented here will be in the form of singular scripts, as software development continuity is the preference. 

TODO: project/colab/homework list.
